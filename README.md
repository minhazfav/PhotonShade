PhotonShade

Physics-based color conversion tool that translates between digital color formats and photon energy:

    Color ↔ [hv (eV), Saturation %, Lightness %, Opacity %]

🎨 Convert from HEX or RGBA to a quantum-inspired color model based on Planck’s equation
🔁 Bidirectional conversion with a simple, educational interface
⚛️ Built for designers, physicists, developers, and anyone who loves light and color

No frameworks. No dependencies. Just color and physics in one page.
